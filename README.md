# Raw Code for Deep Hashing in SelaVPR++

This repository is for reference only. As I am currently busy looking for a job, the complete code will be released before July 31.

The straight-through estimation (STE) processing is implemented in network.py [Line 21](https://github.com/Lu-Feng/Deep_Hashing_in_SelaVPRplusplus/blob/fbc12e9367feee6980c37041a778e02f89f70578/network.py#L21).

The similarity-constrained quantization loss is implemented in train_hashing.py [Lines 224-228](https://github.com/Lu-Feng/Deep_Hashing_in_SelaVPRplusplus/blob/fbc12e9367feee6980c37041a778e02f89f70578/train_hashing.py#L224).
